# anchor-automata

A library to make automation for [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm).

TBD, TBD, TBD

## Status

THIS LIBRARY IS UNDER-DEVELOPMENT STATUS. DON'T USE THIS IN THE PRODUCTION GROUND.

And this won't cover all the functions, i.e. this library implements the functions what I wanted.
But of course, feature requests are welcome.
